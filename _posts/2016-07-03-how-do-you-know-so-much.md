The question that finally drove me to start this blog...

>How do you know so much about JavaScript?

When I was asked this question at 9:45pm after a 3 hour class I had a bit of trouble answering the question. It was pretty obvious because I babbled on saying something along the lines of:

>I research everything I can. I watch JS Conference videos, and...I don't know"

The truth was, I didn't know. I started asking myself do I really even know that much about JavaScript? I started getting into a discussion with myself in my head convincing myself that I couldn't answer this question. I just knew a lot in the student's eyes because I was a TA and they were a student but that's when I took a deep breath, took a step back, and thought a little bit more about the question.

I do know a lot about JavaScript. I may not know the most about JavaScript and depending on who _you_ are, I may not know more than _you_ do about JavaScript but I have no doubt at all that I know more about the language than your average JavaScript developer does and the reason is quite simple: I know how to learn.

# How To Learn: The Drive

I don't know if I'm good at learning because I was raised by two teachers (that probably helps) or just because I have a curious mind but there's one thing that has stood out to me more and more as I progress through my career and it's that I'm just faster at picking stuff up than other people.

It wasn't always like that. My first job to help me get through college was as a Crew Member at Chipotle. I was _terrible_ at this job. I remember one of the other employees taking me to the office in the back and literally telling me: "Hey, you suck at this." I kind of laughed him off because _who cares how good you are at making a burrito_ but I think this is a crucial part of my story. Being told to my face that I was terrible at doing what I was doing was pretty eye opening. I don't remember caring that I sucked at my job (and I did, this guy wasn't a jerk, he was just honest.) All I remember from that moment is realizing that __someone else cares about how good you are at what you do__{: style="color: red"}.

This may *seem* like an obvious fact but the problem is not everyone keeps this in mind. Every single day, you're being judged. If you're at work, you're getting judged. If you're in class, you're getting judged. If you're reading a blog, you're getting judged. If you're writing the blog, you're getting judged. People have opinions. That's how people are and the sooner you realize that people's opinions *do* matter (about some things!) the sooner you can learn.

## Why should other people's opinions affect how I learn?

It's not the actual opinions of you that you should worry about. It's the fact that people are creating opinions about you. Most likely, you'd prefer someone has good opinions towards you rather than bad (especially if they're your employer) but still, we don't care about _what_ someone thinks of us. We only care _that_ they think of is. Once we care about this, we have _a reason_ to make sure people draw _the best_ opinion possible.

## That's when I became the best damn burrito maker ever.

As soon as I accepted that someone else cared about how good I was at my job, I stepped it up. I opened the station the fastest, I took the most orders during our busiest time, I closed the station the fastest, I cleaned the station the fastest, I did everything I could to _be the best_ so that the only opinion someone could make of me was: _Damn, he can make a good burrito._{: style="color: red"}.

## So when do I start learning?

Honestly, as soon as you realize and accept what I've just explained, you're going to start learning. There won't be any tricks. You're going to have a reason to be better at what you do. You're going to have _the drive_ to be the best _whatever_ that you can be but that doesn't mean I can't _provide_ you with some tricks:

# How To Learn: The Steps

These four steps should help you become a better learner:

1. Learn how to Google and don't be afraid to use it.

	This deserves it's own blog post. Googling is not hard but it's not easy either. Some people think they shouldn't Google because they feel they should already know the answer or should be able to get it from their own resources (class lectures, books, etc.) but when we have the power of the entire internet at our fingertips, we should be using it.

2. When you answer your question. Ask another question about the answer.

	This can be hard to do and it can be harder to keep up with but what motivates me is remembering two things: First, someone cares about how good I am at what I do and second, that same someone cares about how good my peers are at how they do what they do.

	If I take the time to get learn _one more thing_ about any given concept then that someone who cares has _a reason_ think higher of me rather than of my peers.

3. Don't ever leave a question unanswered.

	Sometimes you don't have a choice but if you do ever have the option to _just move on_, don't. I've spent entire days just learning about a concept that I didn't understand. When I was done, not only did I understand, I felt like I could teach a class on the subject. I'm not saying ignore your job and worry about yourself (although that can definitely be a healthy thing to do every now and again) but I am saying don't waste your time starting to research a question and do yourself the disservice of never finding an answer.

4. Teach what you've learned to someone else.

	This is a situational step. If you're learning how to add 4 to 5, then you might need to be a first grade teacher to find someone to teach but more often than not, there's someone you can share your findings with. Maybe start a blog? Maybe host a lunch and learn and invite anyone at your company who will listen? Teach your spouse. Teach your dog. Teach your rubber duck! Speaking out loud about something is great and speaking out loud to someone who is capable/willing to ask questions back to you is invaluable

Hopefully you got something out of reading this post. I plan on delving further into these four steps in future blog posts but as always if you have any questions at all feel free to <a href="mailto:josh.madewell@gmail.com">email</a> me and I'd love to talk about anything here!

Thanks for reading.
