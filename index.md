# Welcome

Welcome and thanks for visiting!

I'm Josh Madewell. I began my developing career in 2013 at a small company in Tallahasse, FL. Since then, I've moved to Austin, TX and have had two different jobs as a Node.js/JavaScript developer.

I've made it my goal over the past three years to become the best JavaScript developer I know. After starting to TA at the Coding Bootcamp for UT Austin, I decided to finally build my portfolio and include a blog to answer the question "How do you know so much about JavaScript?" where I plan to explain not only _what_ I've learned, but _how_.
